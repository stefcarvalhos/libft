# Libft

**Libft** is a custom library developed in C as part of the 42 School curriculum. This project consists of recreating essential functions from the C standard library, as well as implementing new utility functions for string manipulation, memory handling, and linked lists. The goal is to consolidate knowledge in C, reinforce good programming practices, and create a reusable static library for future projects.

## 📋 Funcionalidades

Libft includes the recreation of several standard functions from <ctype.h>, <string.h>, <stdlib.h>, and <stdio.h>, along with additional utility functions. Some of the key implementations include:

**Memory management:** ft_memset, ft_bzero, ft_memcpy, ft_memmove, ft_memchr, ft_memcmp
**String manipulation:** ft_strlen, ft_strcpy, ft_strncpy, ft_strdup, ft_strchr, ft_strrchr, ft_strstr, ft_strnstr, ft_strcmp, ft_strncmp
**Character checking & conversion:** ft_isalpha, ft_isdigit, ft_isalnum, ft_isascii, ft_isprint, ft_toupper, ft_tolower
**Linked lists:** ft_lstnew, ft_lstadd_front, ft_lstadd_back, ft_lstsize, ft_lstdelone, ft_lstclear, ft_lstiter, ft_lstmap

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/stefcarvalhos/libft.git
cd libft
```

### 2. Compile the library:
```bash
make
```
